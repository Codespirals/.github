# Codespirals

A GitHub repository to upload and save reusable, broadly generic projects that can be integrated into other projects to reduce code duplication.

## Libraries:
A codespirals module is a code library made for a specific purpose, which is usually described by the module's name and README.
Structure
* Codespirals libraries usually contain anywhere from one to all of the following submodules, depending on size and scope:
  * Shared
    * Collections of interfaces that dictate the outline and behaviour of objects
  * Frontend
    * A set of classes and interfaces building upon the "Shared" package to facilitate the use of the module in a frontend application. 
  * Backend
    * An as generically-as-possible implemented set of the interfaces from the "Shared" package to facilitate adding the module to a user's EF Core database and generally using it in backend code.

## Current generic codespirals packages:
### Libraries
* Base - A few basic interfaces that simplify some basic actions and classes. â˜­ðŸ”‘ Progress: 100% (In testing)
* Api - A set of extensions and code to streamline building an API. â˜­ðŸ”‘ Progress: 40%
* Users - Unified user handling for smaller projects. â˜­ðŸ”‘ Progress: 100% (In testing)

### Solutions
* Mail - A service to very easily implement mailing in any project. â˜­ðŸ”‘ Progress: 90%
* ApiCaller - A service to standardize calling an API from code. â˜­ðŸ”‘ Progress: 100% (In testing)
* Scheduler - A package to easily add a Quartz task scheduler to a project. â˜­ðŸ”‘ Progress: 70%
* Pay - A lightweight solution to implement payment in a project (currently only supports Stripe). â˜­ðŸ”‘ Progress: 80%


## Misc
